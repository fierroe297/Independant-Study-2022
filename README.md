# Independant-Study-2022

To being setup I used a TTGO T12 Board(https://templates.blakadder.com/lilygo_ESP8266_OLED_SH1106.html)
## For setup
  Have Visual Studio Code installed, and download the platformio extension to the application.
  To use the TTGO board properly one must input Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 when searching for boards.
